# Privacy Policy
In short, this extension does *not* transfer, track or share any student, user or usage information.  

The extension has been updated to leverage the [Chrome 'sync'](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage') Services.  In short, this means that if 'sync' is enabled, your class lists will be available on all devices where you are signed in.  If sync is not enabled, class lists  will function as previously with the [LocalStorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage#localStorage) functionality.  All of the 'sync'ing between devices is completed using Google's standard API calls.  As before, your class lists are <u>never</u> saved to external servers. 

The source code for this extension is provided to verify this policy - see [Licence](LICENSE.md).
