Google Meet Attendance is now an full-fledged Chrome extension!

Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fkdjflnaggakjamjkmimcofefhppfljd/publish-accepted?authuser=0&hl=en
And then click `Add to Chrome`

You are now setup!  To see the extension in action, 
Launch a Google Meet (https://meet.google.com)

On meeting join page, you will see `Class List` field - by default, it will appear on the left side on the screen, but you can drag it to whereever you want.  

You can paste, or type, the list of expected `invitees` for your Meet into the field. Enter each name on a separate line. How you enter the names is likely system dependent... in my case, my students appear as "<FIRST> <LAST>". 

So it does not obstruct the screen during your Meet, the `Class List` will `hide` when it loses focus (i.e., it will be come faintly visible when you tab or click outside the field).  If you hover over the field or click within it, it will pop-up to full size again.
   
As participants join the meeting, the extension will automatically update the list - prepending a checkmark to names already in the list and appending names of `uninvited` participants at the bottom.

The contents of the `Class List` field is saved to a LocalStorage variable so it is remembered if you reload the page and (in theory) should be saved if you close Chrome.  I say in theory because my school board automatically flushes LocalStorage variables when you leave Chrome.

There are a few `buttons` above the list of names:
   Click [-] to clear all checks from the list of names (i.e., revert to just the list of names)
   Click [x] to erase all of the names in the field
   Click [x] to manually check the attendance (but in reality, it should not be necessary to do this as the attendance is automatically check)
