<h1>Google Meet Attendance Privacy Policy</h1>
<h3>Updated Apr 13, 2020</h3>

<p>The Google Meet Attendance Extension was created by Al Caughey. It allows you to input a list of invitees to a Google Meet and then updates the list to indicate who actually attended.  It is intended the help teachers, like myself, who are rapidy transitioning to the new reality of online classes.  I will do my best to reply to feature requests or support issues but please understand that my students (and home-life) come first. 
<p>The source code is currently released with a generous MIT license and hosted publicly on GitHub, however, and all pull requests 
  that modify the extension will be evaluated prior to merging them into the main code stream. Instructions for building the extension yourself and hosting your own version will be provided on the 
  README.md document on the GitHub repository.</p>

<p>The list of names entered into the `Attendance` field is persisted in a LocalStorage variable but the extension does not send any of that data anywhere. It doesn’t “phone home” and does not provide any further reporting tools, as it doesn’t gather any data at all. </p>
